# Annotation Tool

A browser-based audio annotation viewer and editor for Praat TextGrid files. This repository also contains code to perform a first-pass automatic speech transcription on an audio file of your choosing.

There are two main components in this repository:
  - **Automatic Audio Transcription** (`asr/`) — transcribe words and phonemes from audio to generate an initial TextGrid
  - **View and Edit Annotation** (`frontend-reactjs/`) — review, correct, and export the annotations from an existing TextGrid

## Documentation

The documentation is split across four files:

**This README** — setup and overview for the annotation viewer
- [Initial Setup](#initial-setup)
- [Demo](#demo)
- [File Structure](#file-structure)

**[TRANSCRIPTION.md](TRANSCRIPTION.md)** — generating an initial TextGrid from audio
- [Audio Transcription](TRANSCRIPTION.md#audio-transcription)

**[USAGE.md](USAGE.md)** — a guide to running the annotation viewer
- [Running the Annotation Viewer](USAGE.md#running-the-annotation-viewer)
- [Tips and Tricks for Annotating](USAGE.md#tips-and-tricks-for-annotating)
- [Keyboard shortcuts — quick reference](USAGE.md#keyboard-shortcuts--quick-reference)

**[ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md)** — advanced audio features
- [Spectrogram & formants](ADVANCED.md#spectrogram--formants)
- [Confidence scores](ADVANCED.md#confidence-scores)
- [In-browser MFA re-alignment](ADVANCED.md#in-browser-mfa-re-alignment)

## Initial Setup

**Pick your platform first** — the steps are different enough that reading straight through causes confusion:
- **macOS or Linux** → [macOS / Linux setup](#macos--linux-setup)
- **Windows** → [Windows setup (via WSL)](#windows-setup-via-wsl) — `setup.sh` is a bash script and won't run directly on Windows

### macOS / Linux setup

Requirements:
- **conda** — [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or Anaconda
- **Node.js v18+** — on macOS, easiest via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
  ```bash
  brew install node
  ```
  Or via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (cross-platform):
  ```bash
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
  # then in a new terminal:
  nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
  ```

Note: There is no audio in the following video.

Setup:
- From the `annotation-tool/` directory, run:
  ```bash
  bash setup.sh
  ```
This creates the necessary conda environments (`aligner`, `whisperx`, and `nemo` on Linux), downloads the MFA English models, and installs the frontend Node dependencies.

**macOS Note:**
- `setup.sh` automatically detects macOS and installs a Mac-compatible `whisperx` environment.
- `nemo` (Parakeet) is currently only supported on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs and will be skipped on macOS.
- WhisperX on Mac will use CPU or MPS (Apple Silicon) for inference.

Once setup finishes:
```bash
cd frontend-reactjs
npm run dev
```
Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser — see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#running-the-annotation-viewer) for the full walkthrough.

### Windows setup (via WSL)

Windows isn't supported directly since `setup.sh` is a bash script — use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instead, which gives you a real Linux environment to run the exact same setup in.

1. Install WSL:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
2. Inside WSL, clone this repository into the WSL filesystem (e.g. under `~/`, **not** `/mnt/c/...`) — accessing files across the Windows/Linux boundary is much slower.
3. Install conda and Node.js inside WSL:
   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/miniconda3
   ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
   # open a new terminal, then:
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
   ```
4. From here on, WSL *is* Linux — run the exact same setup script as the [macOS / Linux](#macos--linux-setup) path above:
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```
5. Start the viewer:
   ```bash
   cd frontend-reactjs
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

## Run it with `npm run dev` (not a static build)

This tool is designed to run **locally in development mode** (`npm run dev`). The Vite dev server isn't just serving the page — it also hosts the Python-backed features and file I/O via local API routes, and (for in-browser re-alignment) talks to `mfa_server.py`.

A static production bundle (`npm run build` → `dist/`) still loads and runs, but these dev-server–only features are unavailable in it:

| Feature | `npm run dev` | Static `dist/` build |
|---|---|---|
| Playback, waveform, tile viewing & editing | ✅ | ✅ |
| Export TextGrid (browser download) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Live frequency crosshair/readout | ✅ | ✅ |
| Enhanced spectrogram & formants/pitch | ✅ | ❌ (needs `/api/compute-dsp` + `aligner` env) |
| Save to disk — `Ctrl/Cmd+S` | ✅ | ❌ (needs `/api/save-textgrid`) |
| Load a `.wav` from outside `public/` | ✅ | ❌ (needs `/api/upload-wav`) |
| In-browser MFA re-alignment (**MFA** button) | ✅ | ❌ (needs `mfa_server.py` on :5050) |

In short: keep using `npm run dev` for the full experience. A hosted/static deployment would need a real backend reimplementing those API routes, which this repo does not ship.
